## [üöß 1. Background](#üöß-1-background)

* Using Python and Pandas, determine which portfolio is performing the best across multiple areas:
    * volatility
    * returns
    * risk 
    * Sharpe ratios
* This python code compares [my custom portfolio](/custom_portfolio/) to [the whales](/Resources/whale_returns.csv) and [two alogorithmic trading strategies](/Resources/algo_returns.csv)
* This code compares if my custom portfolio: 
    * Outperforms
    * Underperforms 
    * Or Equally perfroms 

## [üö¶ 2. Instructions](#üö¶-2-instructions)
* Analyze whale Returns of Soros, Paulson,Tiger and Berkshire 
    * Read the Whale Portfolio daily returns and clean the data 
* Analyze Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 Daily Returns
    * Read the algorithmic daily returns and clean the data
* S&P 500 Returns
    * Read the S&P 500 historic closing prices and create a new daily returns DataFrame from the data.
* Combined Returns
    * Performance Anlysis
    * Calculate and Plot the daily returns.
    * Calculate and Plot cumulative returns.
    * Determine the risk of each portfolio:
        * Create a box plot for each portfolio.
        * Calculate the standard deviation for all portfolios
        * Determine which portfolios are riskier than the S&P 500
        * Calculate the Annualized Standard Deviation
    * Create a box plot for each portfolio
    * Calculate Standard Deviations
        * Determine which portfolios are riskier than the S&P 500
    * Calculate the Annualized Standard Deviation
    * Analyze the rolling statistics for Risk and Beta.
        * Calculate and plot the rolling standard deviation for all portfolios using a 21-day window
        * Calculate the correlation between each stock to determine which portfolios may mimick the S&P 500
    * Choose one portfolio, then calculate and plot the 60-day rolling beta between it and the S&P 500
    * Calculate and Plot Beta for a chosen portfolio and the S&P 500
        *  Try calculating the `ewm` with a 21-day half life for each portfolio, using standard deviation (std) as the metric of interest.
    * Using the daily returns, calculate and visualize the Sharpe ratios using a bar plot
        * Determine whether the algorithmic strategies outperform both the market (S&P 500) and the whales portfolios.
* Create Custom Portfolio
    * Choose 3-5 custom stocks with at last 1 year's worth of historic prices and create a DataFrame of the closing prices and dates for each stock.
        * Calculate the weighted returns for the portfolio assuming an equal number of shares for each stock
            * Join your portfolio returns to the DataFrame that contains all of the portfolio returns
        * Re-run the performance and risk analysis with your portfolio to see how it compares to the others
        * Include correlation analysis to determine which stocks (if any) are correlated
    * Calculate and Plot Rolling 60-day Beta for Your Portfolio compared to the S&P 500
    * Using the daily returns, calculate and visualize the Sharpe ratios using a bar plot
    * How does your portfolio do?
